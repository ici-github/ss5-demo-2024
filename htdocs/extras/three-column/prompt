I want to act as a Web Designer tasked to create the best of the best navigation menu. So here's my structure using dropdown.

1. Students
1.1 View Students
1.2 Edit Students
1.3 Add Students
2. Courses
2.1 View Courses
2.2 Edit Courses
2.3 Add Courses

Please use HTML and CSS to layout these things. Make it the best.
